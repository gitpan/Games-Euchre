=head1 NAME

Games::Euchre - Euchre card game for humans and computers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simply run my game wrapper:

  % euchre.pl

or write your own:

  use Games::Euchre;
  use Games::Euchre::AI::Simple;
  use Games::Euchre::AI::Human;

  my $game = Games::Euchre->new();
  foreach my $i (1..3) {
     $game->setAI($i, Games::Euchre::AI::Simple->new());
  }
  $game->setAI(4, Games::Euchre::AI::Human->new());
  $game->playGame();
  my @scores = sort {$b <=> $a} $game->getScores();
  print("The winner is " . $game->getWinner()->getName() . " with a score of " .
        "$scores[0] to $scores[1]\n");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This software implements the card game of Euchre.  The game is played
with four players composing two teams.  Any of the four players can be
human or computer players, but more than one human is not well
supported yet.

The Games::Euchre::AI module implements a simple framework for adding
new classes of human interfaces or computer opponents.  I recomment
that AI writers use Games::Euchre::AI::Simple (a REALLY dumb computer
opponent) as starting point.

Aside from the ::AI class and its descendents, this package also
implements the following classes: Games::Euchre::Team,
Games::Euchre::Player and Games::Euchre::Trick.

Create and initialize a new Euchre game.

=over 4

=cut

=item enableHangDealer

Turns on the hang-the-dealer game option.  It is off by default.  If
on, this means that the dealer may not pass in the second bidding
round.  Otherwise, the deal passes to the next player and bidding
begins anew.

=cut

sub enableHangDealer {
   my $self = shift;
   $self->{hangdealer} = 1;
   return $self;
}

=item enableNoTrump

Turns on the no-trump game option.  It is off by default.  If on, this
means that in the second round of bidding, players may declare "No
trump".

=cut

sub enableNoTrump {
   my $self = shift;
   $self->{notrump} = 1;
   return $self;
}

=item setAI INDEX AI_OBJECT

Tells the game to use the specified AI instance to control the player
of the given index.  The index must be an integer between 1 and 4.
The AI instance must inherit from Games::Euchre::AI.

=cut

sub setAI {
   my $self = shift;
   my $index = shift; # one-based
   my $ai = shift;
   die "Bad index" unless ($index && $index =~ /^[1-4]$/);
