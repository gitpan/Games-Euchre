=item pickItUp

Allow the player, as dealer, to select which card to trade for the
turned up card.  This method performs the actual trade.  If the player
has an AI instance set, that is invoked.  Otherwise a pathetically

Allow the player to select which card to play on the current trick.
This method performs the actual play.  If the player has an AI
instance set, that is invoked.  Otherwise a pathetically simple AI
chooses the card.

=item isLegalBid TURNNUMBER BID

Given a bid, return a boolean indicating the validity of that bid.
The bid is tested for structure (one of H, C, D, S, N, HA, CA, DA, SA,
NA, or undef), tested against the bidding round (only the turned-up
card suit can be called in round 1 , and may not be called in round
2), against the game options (hang-the-dealer, no-trump).

This is called from the bid() method.
