Games::Euchre

This provides the framework for a game of Euchre.  Any combination of
the four players can be human or computer players (although more than
one human player can be awkward).  A simple interface is available to
alternative computer players to be created.  The supplied human player
interface isn't bad, but the supplied computer player is DUMB!!  

Others are encouraged to create new Games::Euchre::AI::* players,
either human interfaces or computer players, and submit to CPAN.  If
so, you will likely want to copy and edit euchre.pl.  If so, please
send me any recommended changes so I can incorporate them in future
versions.

This game is made possible by Games::Cards by Amir Karger.

You may simply run scripts/euchre.pl directly out of this directory,
or you may install via the usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
  (The euchre.pl file will be installed in your $perlbin directory)

This software is released under the GNU Public License v2.  See
"COPYING".

--- TO DO ---

* Write more robot players
* Randomize initial player number and initial dealer number
* Let user choose human vs. robot players in Euchre.pl
* Change (or allow changes to) player names -- something other than
  "Player n"
* Option to play more than one game
* Record game results in stats file?
* Option for current dealer to redeal after everyone passes, instead
  of handing the deal to the next player.
